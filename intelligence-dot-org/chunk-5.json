"\nThis is a somewhat different notion of \"intelligence\" than you might pick up from Hollywood movies. In Hollywood, an intelligent character is one who speaks in a British accent, and is shown to win in chess games, and occasionally presents Mr. Bond with some incredible technological marvel (if they're a good guy) or makes planning mistakes that a 5-year-old could spot (if they're bad).\n\nAnd in common parlance, \"intelligence\" means a trait that is possessed by mathematicians and physicists (and especially Einstein), and dispossessed by the village idiot, with salespeople and musicians somewhere in the middle.\n\n\"Mathematicians are intelligent\", one might say, \"but intelligence isn't all there is to success--many of the most successful humans are charismatic businessmen, or successful pop stars.\" But charisma is not synthesized in the kidneys! Charisma is a mental process; it is a way that your brain moves around your muscles that leads to desirable outcomes; in our attempts to gesture at \"intelligence\", we gesture also at charisma.  Charisma may not feel like \"thinking hard\", it may not even feel somatically like it's happening inside your head, but charisma still isn't synthesized inside your kidneys.\n\nEnglish does not have a standard word which uniquely means only this concept we're trying to point at, for the thing which humans have more of than mice and have differently from natural selection, for the thing that includes both engineering and charisma as ways that a brain directs a body to solve a complicated challenge from reality.\n\nBy rights, we should perhaps coin a new word, for our notion, something like \"mindpower\", so that when we refer to machines that are adept at “mindpower”, we are free from any connotation that they're adept at chess, but clueless when it comes to romance.\n\n"
