"\nHaving tried to point at the thing-in-the-world, we'll tentatively venture one piece of a definition of intelligence in words.\n\nIn this definition, we'll talk about the work that intelligence does, rather than the mechanisms that perform the work.\n\nIf you ask a wise physicist to define an \"engine\", they will tell you about what sort of *work an engine does*, and they may tell you some principles that govern that work. They might say: \"an engine converts non-mechanical energy into mechanical energy\", and tell you about conservation of energy and how knowing that helps.\n\nThey won't try to come up with some verbal definition that simultaneously describes the inner machinery of both a combustion engine and a hamster wheel. The innards of a rocket engine differ from the innards of an electric motor differ from the innards of a nuclear reactor, and there's not much that can usefully be said of all those innards at once, except that they perform the job of converting energy into mechanical energy, subject to various physical laws governing the conversion.\n\n"
