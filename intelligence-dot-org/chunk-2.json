"\nI will not start by defining intelligence in words. If a stone-age human was trying to discuss fire with their fellow tribe-members, they'd do better by pointing at the hot flickery red-orange stuff and saying \"let's talk about that stuff over there\", rather than saying \"I define 'fire' to be the physical manifestation of the fire-god's anger\".\n\nThe phenomenon precedes any attempt at a definition. We'll give a definition afterwards, but don't make the mistake of the caveman who chortles \"You can't even define fire precisely, nor does your theory account for the fact that some fires burn blue. Therefore, your claim that I should flee before the forest fire consumes me is bunk.\"\n\nThe forest fire is allowed to burn you to ashes, and yes, it is allowed to burn you even before anybody has presented you with a satisfactory definition of fire.\n\n"
