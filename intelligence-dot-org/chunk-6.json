"\nAlas, the word \"intelligence\" is the best that English has.  Worse, it appears in the very widespread term \"artificial intelligence\" that's usually used to refer to a related subject matter.    We ask you to bear with us, as we try to gesture at some thing that seems to exist in the world and doesn't quite have a standard word in English which means only and exactly that thing.  And we beg you to understand, that not everything that everyone uses the word \"intelligence\" to mean, is the thing we're trying to point to.\n\nImagine if some culture used the word \"fire\" in a way where it referred to both the orangey-bright hot stuff and also a burning sense of passion, and maybe also, had a different word for fires that burn naturally versus those that people start or tend.  An aspiring physicist needs to be able to say, \"I want to start by talking about only the orangey-bright hot stuff -- all the orangey-bright hot stuff, whether it's built by people or found in nature\" -- and not be shouted down by people saying \"But you said 'fire', and when I use that word, I mean...\"  In technical textbooks there exists a convention where the author can say, \"I am temporarily, locally using this word to mean only the following thing...\" and this is allowed so long as they use the word consistently and without trying to fluctuate between nonstandard and standard meanings.   We know this isn't a textbook, but we're doing that to 'intelligence' now.  We don't know how the conversation can move forward otherwise.  English doesn't, actually, have a word that everyone already uses to mean only and exactly the thing we want to point to.\n\n---\n"
