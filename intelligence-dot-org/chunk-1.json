"\nBut if you're still alive to read this book, I'd bet that the current set of consumer-accessible AIs probably have some set of stupidities, that dedicated online probers have managed to turn into neat viral examples.  And yeah, maybe if you took some poor ordinary human with the sort of amnesia where they can't form new memories, and had thousands of people repeatedly probe them to find questions to which they'd repeatedly give stupid answers, then you could make that human look stupid too.  But (as of May 2024) I think the stupidity is real; ChatGPT 4 is not quite up to human par.\n\nChatGPT 4 wasn't the sort of device where, if anyone builds it, everyone dies.  I don't just mean this in the trivially observable sense that I survived to write this, but in the sense that it wasn't what we were originally worried about two decades earlier.\n\nSo what then is this \"intelligence\" stuff, that we are worried may be made \"artificially\", if it's not just the property of \"talking like a person\"?\n\n---\n"
