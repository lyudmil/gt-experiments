"\nOn our viewpoint, we'd say there's two kinds of work involved in intelligence; importantly different even though they are interrelated, intertwined, and somewhat interconvertible.  There's even mathematical support for this perspective, and current machine learning systems partially reflect these unspoken mathematical reasons.  We mention this, not because we're going to throw the math at you right away, but because if you're wondering why we picked these two kinds of work and not twenty other different plausible-sounding kinds of work, the answer is that this is what the math supports.  More on this later.\n\nThe first kind of work we'd say is done by an engine of intelligence is \"guessing what will next be seen, before you see it\" -- not just, say, predicting the outcome of a sports game that you want to bet on; but also the wordless anticipation when you look out the window that your eyes will see a blue sky or a gray sky, rather than flashing orange and green.\n\nThe second kind of work is \"moving or choosing in a way that brings you to a particular destination or outcome\" -- not just choosing the path you take to drive across a city to get to a particular grocery, say, but also how your brain sends motor signals to your muscles to keep you upright.\n\nWe'll call them \"prediction\" and \"steering\".\n\n"
